#1
line (x+22, y+22, x+22, y+22);

just wanted to see what kind of lines it drew, turned out to be diagonal

had to set the second x and y to be the right coordinates

set the second y variable to equal the first one, creating a horizontal line

Repeated the previous step for the second line, except for the x variable, to create verticle lines

Decided to make the line length 6, so that 3 would be the medial, which is where the second line would go


#2
replaced the line() code from the first assignment with
rectMode(CENTER);
fill(100);
rect(25+x, 25+y, 6, 6);

because the line length was 6, so the center would be 3, 22+3=25. 

I was expecting the squares to be grey, and they were, but I need to figure out how to make the fill random

Im guessing there is a random() command or something similar, cant remember
