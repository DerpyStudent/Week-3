#1
line (x+22, y+22, x+22, y+22);

just wanted to see what kind of lines it drew, turned out to be diagonal

had to set the second x and y to be the right coordinates

set the second y variable to equal the first one, creating a horizontal line

Repeated the previous step for the second line, except for the x variable, to create verticle lines

Decided to make the line length 6, so that 3 would be the medial, which is where the second line would go


#2
replaced the line() code from the first assignment with
rectMode(CENTER);
fill(100);
rect(25+x, 25+y, 6, 6);

because the line length was 6, so the center would be 3, 22+3=25. 

I was expecting the squares to be grey, and they were, but I need to figure out how to make the fill random

Im guessing there is a random() command or something similar, cant remember

I tried fill(random(255));

it made it random shades of gray, animated

tried 

fill(random(255), random(255), random(255));

made it random fill colors, and animated, black border on each square

is there a border or noBorder() command?

stroke(255) did the trick

still animated though

decided to make the width and height bigger because I like it more

added noLoop(); to setup, made it stop being animated

#3

Using the previous code, I have a grid of white squares with black stroke

Trried adding a code for white squares with with borders, and random(0,100)*x+25

Didnt work, only got rid of first square

changed the parameters of random() to 0,10

Now I have random white on white squares, but they dotn voerlap the old spots

tried to use an array, did not work

created a if statement using random

float rand=random(0,50);
if(rand<25){
tried to add at the beginning of the draw() function
it applied it to all of the squares at once

Was asked by JD, where am I drawing a square, so I added the if statement to right before the line command.

       float rand= random(0,50);
  if (rand<25) {
      rect(25+x, 25+y, 15, 15);
      
it worked

adjusted density of squares by making more draw

#4
used the code from the previous, but had to set the background to change to white, and removed noLoop();

tried background to white at the end, JD said to add at the beginning of the draw
it worked

now I just have to change it to crosses from squares

copying the code from the first assignment worked, but the animation is too fast

halved the framerate: frameRate(15);

it fixed it, so pretty

#5 tried adding an ellipse, it worked, using mouseX and mouseY, but its drawing too many

tried using spotlight(); but the syntax isnt working for me?
